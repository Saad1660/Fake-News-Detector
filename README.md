# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection Web App

I built a simple **fake news detection system** using machine learning and natural language processing.  
The idea was to create a tool that could read a news article and tell whether itâ€™s likely to be **real or fake**.

I used a publicly available dataset from Kaggle containing real and fake news articles. After cleaning the text, I trained a **Logistic Regression model** using **TF-IDF** features, and it gave me around **90% accuracy**.

Then, to make it more interactive and easy to share, I turned the model into a **Streamlit web app**. Anyone can paste news text into the app, click a button, and instantly see if itâ€™s real or fake â€” all from a browser.

This project helped me understand how text preprocessing, model training, and deployment work together â€” and it made me even more interested in using AI for solving real-world problems like misinformation.
